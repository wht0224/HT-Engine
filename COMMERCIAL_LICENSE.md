## Preface: Why I Don't Charge Revenue Share (Yet)

Hi, I'm Wang Ruilin, the creator of HT_Engine. I'm currently a minor (16 years old) and cannot legally establish a company or audit financial records. That's why this commercial license uses a **simple annual fee model** for now.

**My Philosophy:**

I believe in **"Survival First, Profit Second"**. Many successful indie games were created by developers who struggled financially at the beginning. I want to support developers who have great ideas but limited resources, giving them a chance to succeed before asking for anything in return.

**My Promise:**
- I don't take money from the poor
- I don't hurt those who are working hard
- I let people survive first, then talk about profit

**Current Stage (Author is Minor):**
- Simple annual fees, no revenue share
- No need to report income or show financial records
- Just pay the annual fee based on your developer category

**Future Stage (After Author Becomes Adult):**
- Annual fee + revenue share model
- I will establish a company and can legally audit records
- More flexible pricing based on actual revenue

I believe this approach helps struggling developers get started, and when they succeed, we succeed together.

## 2. License Types and Fees

### 2.1 Current Stage (Author is Minor)

Until I become an adult and establish a company, I use a **simple annual fee model** with no revenue share.

| Developer Type | Annual Fee | Notes |
|---------------|------------|-------|
| Impoverished Developer / Impoverished Student | Year 1: $0<br>Year 2: $5<br>Year 3+: $10 | Poverty proof required |
| Regular Student | $10/year | Student ID required |
| Individual Developer | $49/year | Independent developer |
| Small Team (≤5 people) | $200/year | Up to 5 team members |
| Medium Team (6-20 people) | $1000/year | 6-20 team members |
| Large Enterprise (>20 people) | $3000/year | More than 20 team members |

**Notes:**
- Annual fee is clearly priced, no need to report income
- Pay the corresponding annual fee regardless of revenue
- Impoverished developer fees increase gradually to help them become self-sufficient

### 2.2 Future Stage (After Author Becomes Adult and Establishes Company)

After I become an adult and establish a company, I will switch to **annual fee + revenue share** model.

#### 2.2.1 Impoverished Developer / Impoverished Student Revenue Share

- Annual revenue ≥ $100,000: Apply above rates

#### 2.2.2 Individual Developer Revenue Share

**Income Threshold:**
